# TELUGU-DATASET
We created the Telugu dataset to address the challenge of building Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems for Indian languages, considering the constraints of limited resources.  The dataset includes recordings of common Telugu words spoken by native speakers from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.

# Repository structure

•	The dataset comprises 2050 audio files featuring spoken Telugu words by native speakers from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.

•	Each speaker's recordings are organized within a dedicated directory.

•	The "Telugu_meta.txt" file supplements the dataset, offering meta information, including name, age, gender, and native region for each speaker.
