# TELUGU-DATASET
We created the Telugu dataset to address the challenge of building Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems for Indian languages, considering the constraints of limited resources.  The dataset includes recordings of common Telugu words spoken by native speakers from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.
